Code Louisville ASP.NET 5 MVC 6 Project

********************************************************** About. ************************************************************

Hi there! (ஐ╹◡╹)ノ

If you are seeing this, then you are playing on my GitHub page - and I appreciate that! 
This web application is my very first attempt at using C# and ASP.NET 5 MVC 6. 
My database for these games is written in SQL. And has all CRUD capabilities! 
This is still a work in progress as I learn more and more~

Things that Work!
-Registration and Login
-Connection to Database
-Create, Read, Update, and Delete from Database
-Basic Functionality
-Mobile Friendly

Things I'm Working On:
-Adding Reviews
-User Roles and Restrictions
-Custom Graphics

Things I broke... T_T
- View Model
- {"The INSERT statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint \"FK_Review_Game_GameID\". The conflict occurred in database \"aspnet5-louindiegames-35ff722a-6ab1-4bf4-a040-dda546637e92\", table \"dbo.Game\", column 'GameID'.\r\nThe statement has been terminated."}
