********************************************************** About. ************************************************************

Hi there! (ஐ╹◡╹)ノ

If you are seeing this, then you are playing on my GitHub page - and I appreciate that! 
This web application is my very first attempt at using C# and ASP.NET 5 MVC 6. 
My database for these games is written in SQL. And has all CRUD capabilities! 
This is still a work in progress as I learn more and more~

Things that Work!
-Registration and Login
-Connection to Database
-Create, Read, Update, and Delete from Database
-Basic Functionality
-Mobile Friendly

Things I'm Working On:
-Adding Reviews
-User Roles and Restrictions
-Custom Graphics
